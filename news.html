<br />
Anna University Vice-Chancellor MK Surappa told TNIE that around 650 beds in the campus have already been handed over to repurpose as isolation wards and that the varsity cannot make more space.&nbsp; "We have handed over space for 650 beds in the Postgraduate Hostel and the Knowledge Block to the Corporation already," he said.<br />
<br />
The Chennai Corporation has asked the varsity to hand over space for 1,000 additional beds. Surappa said that this would mean handing over hostels currently used by students.&nbsp; "The other hostel rooms in the varsity are occupied by students' belongings. We cannot clear their belongings without permission," he said.<br />
<br />
When contacted a senior corporation official said that 650 beds are already in use for railway quarantine. “Ideally they should give (the additional beds) since it’s also a government body and when another government body is asking, they should make arrangements for it,” said a senior Corporation official. A notice has been issued in this regard earlier, he added.<br />
